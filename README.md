# Analyzing Museum Diversity Through Exploratory Analysis

## By: Emma Chi, Shiyu Murashima, Kara Chu, Isabel Tao, Madeline Zhang

In this project, we explored various trends among demographics and displayed artists in museums in the United States using visual exploratory analysis. After each finding appropriate datasets, we each explored a different trend, then compiled our visualizations and analysis into an article in which we analyzed the diversity, or concluded lack thereof, among and within museums. I investigated the distribution of ethnicities of artists displayed in major U.S. museums over the span of the past 400 years, ultimately finding that representation for minority artists had not significantly increased over this period of time.
